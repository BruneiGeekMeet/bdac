Brunei Darussalam Aids Council (BDAC) is an organization tackling the HIV & AIDS situation in Brunei Darussalam, where it aims to educate the public on related issues, the likes of Sexually Transmitted Infection, Unwanted Pregnancy & Social issues. The council uses multiple approaches in reaching its objectives; youth work & trainings, youth & community participation, outreach programs, voluntary work, media coverage, collaboration with other agencies etc.

**Problem**
- No database management for BDAC trained members and volunteers.
- Difficulty in tracking members and volunteers. Currently there is no database/ system installed to assist tracking.
